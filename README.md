# x-window-apps
Source code from "X Window Application Programming" (1992).

The original book's source code provided on floppy is available [here](X-Window-Applications-Programming.img).

This repo is an upgrade of the code from K&R to ANSI89 with some edits of my own.

The code is old and I'm prone to mistakes, so I can't guarentee anything here is free of errors.
